	**	3/9	Lowered the amouont dt increases at converge from 1.5 to 1.25 hope
			this will make the simulation run longer. 
			
			sim-5* is the same as sim-1 except for the fix mentioned above
			sim-8* continues on sim-5* but now Sn grain 2 has (100) in Z-dir and Sn grain 				3 has (110) in Z-dir, with the c-axis tilted slightly.
